Coppola, who was from Pittsburgh, was a big fan of the team. He decided to make a movie about them called “The gamble”. The gamble was not only a movie about the Steelers but it was also a way for Coppola to invest in the team. He put up $200,000 of his own money in order to make the movie. The gamble was filmed during the 1974 season and chronicles the Steelers’ journey to the playoffs.</p>
<p>The gamble was not a success commercially but it did help to revitalize the Steelers franchise. The gamble was shown on TV at least twice a year for over 20 years and it helped to create some of the biggest Steeler fans in history. One of those fans is none other than tiger casino himself. Tiger casino has been a big supporter of the Steelers for many years and he has even donated money to the team’s charity foundation.</p>
