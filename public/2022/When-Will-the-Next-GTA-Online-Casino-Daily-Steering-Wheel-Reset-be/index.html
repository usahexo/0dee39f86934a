<p>The Casino update introduced the Daily Steering Wheel rewards, which rotate on a daily basis. Players who spin the wheel can win various prizes, including double the amount of money they wagered, bonus cash, and chips.</p>
<p>There is no set schedule for the reset, but it typically takes place at around 10am PT/1pm ET. So far, the reset has always occurred on a weekday.</p>
<p>We will update this article as soon as we have any news about when the next reset will take place.</p>
<h1 id="GTA-Online-Casino-Steering-Wheel-Reset-Schedule-Leaked"><a href="#GTA-Online-Casino-Steering-Wheel-Reset-Schedule-Leaked" class="headerlink" title="GTA Online Casino Steering Wheel Reset Schedule Leaked!"></a>GTA Online Casino Steering Wheel Reset Schedule Leaked!</h1><p>There’s a lot of speculation going around lately about the upcoming GTA Online Casino Update. Rockstar is staying tight-lipped on release date and contents, but that doesn’t stop the rumor mill from churning. One of the latest bits of gossip to make the rounds is a purported leak of the reset schedule for the in-game casino steering wheel.</p>
<p>According to the leak, players will only have a limited window of time to earn rewards from using the steering wheel. Once the timer runs out, all progress made with it will be reset and players will have to start over from scratch.</p>
<p>Naturally, this news has sent the GTA community into a frenzy as everyone scrambles to earn as many rewards as possible before the reset goes into effect. Some are even suggesting that it might be worth starting up new characters just to take advantage of the casino steering wheel during its brief window of availability.</p>
<p>Whether or not this leak is legit remains to be seen, but it’s definitely gotten people talking about GTA Online in a new way. Whatever Rockstar has planned for us with regard to the casino update, it’s clear that they’re not done surprising us yet.</p>
<h1 id="When-is-the-next-GTA-Online-Casino-reset"><a href="#When-is-the-next-GTA-Online-Casino-reset" class="headerlink" title="When is the next GTA Online Casino reset?"></a>When is the next GTA Online Casino reset?</h1><p>The next GTA Online Casino reset is expected to happen in the near future. Rockstar has not yet announced an exact date, but they have said that it will happen “soon.”</p>
<p>Players have been eagerly waiting for the reset, as it will bring with it a number of new features and changes. These include a new Casino management system, as well as new high-stakes gambling games.</p>
<p>Your progress in the Casino up until now will be reset with the update, so you’ll need to start over again from scratch. This includes your rank, progress towards unlocks, and your bank balance.</p>
<p>So far, Rockstar has not released any information about what rewards players can expect for reaching certain ranks in the Casino. However, they have said that there will be new rewards for those who reach the top tiers.</p>
<p>There is no word yet on what these rewards might be, but we can expect them to be something pretty special. After all, Rockstar doesn’t want players to feel like they’re wasting their time by progressing through the Casino ranks.</p>
<p>In addition to the new rewards, Rockstar is also planning to adjust some of the existing ones. The most notable change is to the Lucky Wheel spin bonus. This will now give players double the amount of chips than it did before.</p>
<p>Rockstar is also making some changes to the way betting works in the Casino. Players will now be able to bet up to $500 million on each game, which should make things a lot more interesting!</p>
<h1 id="Rockstar-confirms-daily-steering-wheel-reset-for-GTA-Online-Casino"><a href="#Rockstar-confirms-daily-steering-wheel-reset-for-GTA-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Rockstar confirms daily steering wheel reset for GTA Online Casino"></a>Rockstar confirms daily steering wheel reset for GTA Online Casino</h1><p>Rockstar Games has confirmed that a daily steering wheel reset will be required to play at the GTA Online Casino.</p>
<p>“We can confirm that a daily steering wheel reset will be required to play at the GTA Online Casino,” said Rockstar Games in a statement. “This is to ensure fairness and parity across all tables.”</p>
<p>The news comes as a surprise to many GTA Online players, who were expecting the Casino to open with a variety of games available. It’s unclear as of now what other measures Rockstar plans to put in place to ensure “fairness and parity” across all tables.</p>
<p>Some gamers are speculating that this may be an attempt by Rockstar to reduce the amount of cheating that occurs in GTA Online casinos. Others are simply angry that they’ll have to reset their wheel every day in order to play.</p>
<p>Rockstar has not yet given an indication as to when the GTA Online Casino will open for business.</p>
<h1 id="When-is-the-next-GTA-Online-Casino-reset-Find-out-now"><a href="#When-is-the-next-GTA-Online-Casino-reset-Find-out-now" class="headerlink" title="When is the next GTA Online Casino reset? Find out now!"></a>When is the next GTA Online Casino reset? Find out now!</h1><p>The next GTA Online Casino reset is coming soon! All Casino players are eagerly waiting to see when Rockstar will decide to reset the Casino again. There’s always speculation and rumours going around as to when this might happen, but we’ve decided to clear things up and give you the latest information on the next reset.</p>
<p>So far, Rockstar has been pretty vague about an exact date for the reset. For all we know, it could happen tomorrow or in a few weeks’ time. However, we can narrow it down a little bit by taking a look at past resets.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Rockstar resets the Casino every few months. In June they did a big reset that brought new content and challenges to the table. So based on this pattern, it’s likely that they will do another reset in either August or September. Of course, this is only an estimate and things could always change, but it’s worth keeping in mind as we get closer to those months.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there are still plenty of things to do in the Casino. You can continue spinning the slots and playing games like blackjack and roulette. There are also new rewards to unlock, so make sure you keep grinding those levels!</p>
<p>We hope this article has helped clear up some of the uncertainty around the next GTA Online Casino reset. Stay tuned for more updates as they come in!</p>
