Nebraska lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would lower the gambling age for plushies from 21 to 18.</p>
<p>Introduced by State Senator Tyson Larson, LB 986 would make it legal for those aged 18 and older to gamble at establishments that offer plush toy games. These games include activities like Whack-A-Mole, Skee Ball, and Pinball.</p>
<p>“The thought behind this bill is that if we can bring these types of games to our local businesses, it will help keep people in our state and increase tourism,” Larson said in a statement.</p>
<p>If the bill is passed, Nebraska would join a growing number of states where the gambling age for plush toy games is 18. This includes Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.</p>
<p>Proponents of LB 986 argue that it will help create jobs and boost the economy by bringing in more tourists. They also say that it will give Nebraskans a chance to experience these types of games without having to travel out of state.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased rates of problem gambling among young people. They also say that it could put minors at risk for exposure to gambling addiction and other negative consequences.</p>

<p>A recent outbreak of plushie-mania has caused a rift among Nebraska lawmakers.</p>
<p>On one side are those who support giving plush toys to children in state custody as a way to comfort them and ease their transition into new homes.</p>
<p>Senator Matt Hansen, a sponsor of the bill that would provide plush toys to these children, said, “The research is clear: stuffed animals help children feel safe and loved. These kids have already been through a lot; we should do whatever we can to make them feel comfortable and happy.”</p>
<p>On the other side are those who argue that providing plush toys to children in state custody sends the wrong message and reinforces the idea that they are not good enough as they are.</p>
<p>Representative Peter Ricketts said, “These kids are coming from traumatic backgrounds; we need to be firm with them, not cuddly. We need to be showing them that they will be held accountable for their actions, not giving them distractions with fluffy animals.”</p>
<p>The bill has passed through committee but has yet to come up for a vote in the full Senate or House.</p>
<h1 id="Lowering-the-Gambling-Age-for-Plushies-Could-Hurt-Local-Economy"><a href="#Lowering-the-Gambling-Age-for-Plushies-Could-Hurt-Local-Economy" class="headerlink" title="Lowering the Gambling Age for Plushies Could Hurt Local Economy"></a>Lowering the Gambling Age for Plushies Could Hurt Local Economy</h1><p>The gambling age for plushies is currently at 18 years old, but some people are pushing for it to be lowered to 16.</p>
<p>If this were to happen, it would likely have a negative impact on the local economy, as adults would likely spend less money on plushies if they could gamble with them at a younger age.</p>
<p>There is also the potential for underage gambling to lead to addiction and other problems down the line.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we believe that the gambling age for plushies should remain at 18.</p>

<p>The craze, which began in Lincoln and has since spread to other cities in the state, is fueled by social media posts of people winning large stuffed animals. Some people have even won cars.</p>
<p>State Senator Russ Karpisek is one of the lawmakers pushing for a higher legal gambling age. “We can’t sit back and let our young people get sucked into this type of activity,” he said. “It’s not healthy for them.”</p>
<p>Opponents of raising the legal gambling age say it’s unnecessary and will only serve to drive the gambling underground. “If someone wants to gamble, they’re going to find a way to do it,” said state representative Dan Hughes.</p>
<p>The debate is expected to continue until the legislature adjourns later this month.</p>
<h1 id="Nebraska-Considers-Lowering-Gambling-Age-for-Plushies"><a href="#Nebraska-Considers-Lowering-Gambling-Age-for-Plushies" class="headerlink" title="Nebraska Considers Lowering Gambling Age for Plushies"></a>Nebraska Considers Lowering Gambling Age for Plushies</h1><p>In the state of Nebraska, there is a proposal to lower the legal gambling age from 21 to 18 for plush toy contests. These contests, often known as “plushie” gambling, involve betting on stuffed animals.</p>
<p>The bill was proposed by State Senator Harper and it has already passed through the first round of voting. The reasoning behind the bill is that it would help promote economic development in Nebraska. It is also thought that the current gambling age restriction is not helping to prevent problem gambling.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to more underage gambling and addiction problems. They also point out that there is no evidence that lowering the gambling age would have any positive effect on the economy.</p>
<p>If the bill does pass, Nebraska would be the first state in the US to allow underage gambling for plush toy contests.</p>
