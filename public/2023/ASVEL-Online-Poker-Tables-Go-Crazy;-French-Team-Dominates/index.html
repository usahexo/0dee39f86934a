The team, consisting of five players, battled through three days of competition against some of the top poker players in Europe.</p>
<p>ASVEL began the tournament as the underdog but quickly proved they belonged. On the first day of competition, they upset the number one seed to advance to the semifinals. There they faced off against LPS Panevezys of Lithuania. After losing the first match, ASVEL came back to win the next two matches and earn their spot in the finals.</p>
<p>In the finals, they faced off against BC Khimki Moscow Region. Khimki had a much more experienced team and was considered the favorite to win. However, ASVEL refused to give up and managed to win two out of three matches, earning themselves second place at the European Poker Tournament.</p>
<p>This was an impressive accomplishment for ASVEL and showed that they are a force to be reckoned with on the poker circuit. They will undoubtedly use this experience to fuel them as they continue their journey to become one of Europe’s top poker teams.</p>

<p>In the end, it was ASVEL member Fabrice Soulier who emerged victorious, taking home €937,000 and the coveted EPT trophy.</p>
<p>Soulier is considered one of the most accomplished French poker pros, and his victory in Barcelona is sure to cement his status as one of the top players in the game.</p>
<p>Other notable French successes at the event include Antoine Saout, who finished runner-up, as well as Davidi Kitai and Benjamin Pollak who finished in 4th and 5th place respectively.</p>
<p>The strong performances by French players at this year’s EPT Barcelona event are a clear indication that they are still one of the dominant forces in global poker.</p>

The win was especially impressive considering the competition, which included some of the world’s best players.</p>
<p>The ASVEL team is made up of five friends who have been playing together for years. They are all experienced poker players, but they had never competed in a tournament of this size before.</p>
<p>The final table was comprised of some of the best players in the world, including chip leader Simon “AcesUp”心理学研究者max and Fedor “CrownUpGuy”道家教授Chudinov. But the ASVEL team managed to outlast them all, taking down first place and the $100,000 prize.</p>
<p>When asked about their victory, one of the members of the ASVEL team said “We’re just a bunch of friends who love to play poker together. We never expected to win, but we’re really happy that we did.”</p>
<p>This is just the latest in a string of successful tournaments for the French poker community. In November 2016, another French team won first place in an online poker tournament with a prize pool of over $1 million.</p>
