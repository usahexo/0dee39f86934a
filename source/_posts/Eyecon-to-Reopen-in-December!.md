#  Eyecon to Reopen in December!

After being closed for nearly a year, Eyecon is set to reopen in December with a new owner and a revamped business model.

The popular arcade and entertainment center closed its doors last December, citing financial difficulties. However, the company has now been purchased by new owners and is scheduled to reopen in just a few weeks.

According to the new owners, the business will be moving away from its traditional arcade model and will be focusing more on family-friendly entertainment. This includes plans for a large-scale playground, as well as an indoor miniature golf course.

In addition, the arcade will now offer free Wi-Fi and include a coffee shop. The goal is to create a space where families can come and spend the day enjoying themselves.

"We're really excited about this reopening," said one of the new owners. "We hope to create an enjoyable experience for people of all ages."
