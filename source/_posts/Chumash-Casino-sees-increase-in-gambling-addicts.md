#  Chumash Casino sees increase in gambling addicts

The Chumash Casino Resort in Santa Barbara County is seeing an increase in the number of people addicted to gambling, according to tribal officials.

The officials say that the casino has instituted a number of measures to try to combat the problem, but they concede that more needs to be done.

"People are coming here and losing their life savings," said one tribal official. "We're seeing more and more people who can't afford to pay their rent or buy food because they've lost everything at the casino."

In response to the problem, the casino has limited the amount of money that people can bring in and has banned those who have been caught gambling excessively from returning.

Tribal officials say they are also working with local schools and churches to try to get the word out about the dangers of gambling addiction.
