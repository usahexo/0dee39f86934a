#  New Skin in Sports Betting: Valencia Basket

The Spanish professional basketball team - Valencia Basket Club, has announced a new sponsorship agreement with the Canadian-owned international gaming company The Stars Group. The multi-year agreement will see The Stars Group become the exclusive global betting partner of Valencia Basket and its affiliated teams, as well as receive branding across the club's digital and physical assets.

Commenting on the new partnership, Salvador Aliaga, CEO of Valencia Basket, said: "This agreement with The Stars Group represents one of the most important steps in our club's history. We are extremely proud to have reached an agreement with such a prestigious company and we are looking forward to working together to create a successful long-term relationship."

The Stars Group's President and Chief Executive Officer, Rafi Ashkenazi, added: "We are very excited to be partnering with Valencia Basket Club. This is a highly respected team with a rich history in Spanish basketball. We look forward to working closely with them to provide our customers with an exciting experience around the matches and helping to grow the popularity of the sport."

Under the terms of the deal, The Stars Group will have exclusive rights to use Valencia Basket's trademarks and intellectual property in connection with its sports betting products worldwide. It will also be able to promote its brands directly to fans at all home games in both the Liga ACB (the top tier Spanish men's professional basketball league) and EuroCup (the second-tier European professional men's basketball competition).

For Valencia Basket Club, this new sponsorship agreement is another major step in its efforts to expand its international profile. With The Stars Group as its global betting partner, it now has a powerful ally in its quest to make itself one of the leading forces in European basketball.

#  Valencia Basket Scores Huge Upset in Euroleague

Valencia Basket achieved a huge upset in the Euroleague by defeating reigning champions Olympiacos Piraeus 71-68. Valencia was led by Will Thomas, who scored 22 points and pulled down 9 rebounds. The victory improves Valencia's record to 6-4, while Olympiacos falls to 7-3.

Valencia played excellent defense throughout the game, holding Olympiacos to just 38% shooting from the field. They were also very efficient offensively, shooting 52% from the field themselves. Valencia's veterans chipped in throughout the game, with Thomas, Fernando San Emeterio (14 points), and Bojan Dubljevic (10 points) all scoring in double figures.

Olympiacos had no answers for Thomas down low, and ultimately couldn't overcome Valencia's hot shooting in the end. This is a huge win for Valencia and should give them a lot of confidence as they continue their Euroleague campaign.

#  NBA News: Valencia Basket Signs Big-Name Free Agent

Valencia Basket, a professional basketball club in the Liga ACB and the EuroCup, has announced that they have signed free agent big man Joakim Noah to a one-year deal.

Noah is a 10-year NBA veteran who most recently played for the New York Knicks. He averaged 5.7 points and 8.8 rebounds in 25 minutes per game last season.

For Valencia, this is a major signing as they look to improve upon their disappointing 2018-19 season. In addition to Noah, they have also brought in former NBA player Jerome Jordan and Brazilian center Gabriel Deck.

Noah is expected to be the starting center for Valencia and will likely be joined in the frontcourt by Jordan and Deck. This trio should be able to give opponents plenty of trouble with their size and athleticism.

Valencia Basket's next game is on October 5th against FC Barcelona Lassa.

#  Valencia Basket Looking to Shed Underdog Label

After making the leap to become a EuroCup champion last season, Valencia Basket Club is now looking to shed its underdog label in this year’s FIBA Champions League.

Valencia was one of the biggest surprises in European basketball last season. The team, which has never won a continental title before, reached the final of the 2017-18 EuroCup with relative ease, knocking off several more experienced clubs along the way. In the final, they narrowly defeated Italy’s Virtus Bologna 103-97 in overtime.

This year, Valencia is back in Europe’s top club competition, the FIBA Champions League. The group stage begins on Tuesday, and Valencia is in a tough group that includes powerhouses CSKA Moscow and Real Madrid.

Valencia head coach Sergio Scariolo is well aware of the challenge his team faces in this year’s Champions League. “We are up against very tough opponents, but we will give it our all to get out of this group and make it far into the competition,” said Scariolo.

Despite being underdogs heading into this year’s Champions League, Valencia Basket Club certainly has what it takes to pull off an upset or two. Players like Kyle Hines and Bojan Dubljevic are proven veterans who can lead the team to success in big games. And with head coach Sergio Scariolo at the helm, Valencia will always have a chance to win no matter who they are playing against.

#  Euroleague Odds: Valencia Basket a Dark Horse

The Euroleague begins its 2018-19 season this week and there is no shortage of storylines. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Real Madrid are the defending champions, while last year’s runner-up CSKA Moscow will be led by new acquisition Nando De Colo. But there is another team that bears watching: Valencia Basket.

Valencia had a breakout season in 2017-18, finishing in fourth place in the standings and reaching the playoffs for the first time since 2007. They made even more noise in the playoffs, knocking off top seed Olympiacos in the quarterfinals before losing to CSKA Moscow in the semifinals.

This year’s squad is headlined by Spanish national team member Fernando San Emeterio and American guard Bo McCalebb. But what makes Valencia a dark horse candidate to win it all is their depth; they have 11 players who can all contribute.

Valencia opens their season on Wednesday against Anadolu Efes Istanbul. They are expected to be one of the contenders for one of the four playoff spots, but with their talent and experience, they could make a serious run at the title.
