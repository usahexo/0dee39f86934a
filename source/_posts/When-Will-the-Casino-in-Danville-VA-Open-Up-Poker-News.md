#  When Will the Casino in Danville VA Open Up Poker News?

Casino in Danville VA is expected to open up in the near future, but the date is still unknown. The casino is owned by Penn National Gaming, and it will have a poker room. There are many other casinos in the area, so there is already competition for the customer base.

There are no specific plans yet as to what the opening date will be, but it is expected to happen sometime in 2019. There was an earlier planned opening for late 2018, but that did not come to fruition. The delay could be due to construction or licensing issues.

The casino is being built on the site of the old Danville Regional Airport. It will have a gaming floor of about 50,000 square feet, which is relatively small for a casino. It will have 350 slot machines and 14 table games. The poker room will have 10 tables.

The nearest casinos are already established and well-known in the area. The Hollywood Casino in Charles Town WV is about 30 minutes away, and there are also casinos in Richmond and Chase City VA. There is already some competition for the casino customer base before it has even opened its doors.

Penn National Gaming already operates a number of casinos across the country. It has 39 properties in 18 states. In addition to its ownership of the Casino in Danville VA, it also owns Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, which is close by.

The company has been expanding rapidly over the past few years. In 2015, it bought Pinnacle Entertainment for $2.8 billion. That gave it control of 16 casinos and 3 racetracks across 10 states. The acquisition of Pinnacle made Penn National Gaming the second-largest casino operator in America behind Caesars Entertainment Corp.

Penn National Gaming has been focusing on building its online presence as well. In 2018, it acquired Brandywine Realty Trust’s Xcite Energy LLC for $270 million. That gave it control of three Philadelphia-area racetracks that offer online gaming services such as slots and virtual horseracing betting (in partnership with Churchill Downs).

#  Danville VA Casino Still on Hold for Poker News

Casino officials in Danville, Virginia are still waiting on an answer from the state as to whether or not they will be allowed to offer poker games. The delay in a decision has left many anxious, as the casino was originally supposed to launch its poker room in late December.

“We’re still hopeful that we can get an answer soon and open our poker room, but there’s no guarantee,” said casino spokesperson Shawn Switzer. The hold-up is reportedly due to concerns from Attorney General Mark Herring about the potential for money laundering.

Danville Casino officials have been working with the state since February of last year to get approval for their poker room. They even went so far as to agree to certain conditions, such as using only licensed dealers and prohibiting cash games. In spite of these concessions, approval has yet to be granted.

Meanwhile, casinos in other parts of the state are moving ahead with their plans for poker rooms. For example, Arlington casino operator Penn National Gaming has already installed dozens of gaming machines and hired dealers in anticipation of offering live poker later this year.

The lack of a decision from the state is frustrating for casino officials in Danville. Not only are they losing out on potential revenue from poker players, but they’re also at a disadvantage compared to their competitors.

“It just seems like we’re getting the runaround,” said Switzer. “Everyone else seems to be able to offer poker except us. We just want a level playing field.”

#  Poker Fans Eye Danville VA Casino Opening Date

The Casino at Danville, VA is quickly becoming one of the most anticipated casino openings in the country. Poker fans in particular are eager to see what kind of poker offerings the property will have. The casino is set to open on December 15th, and it will feature 36 table games and a 14-table poker room.

There has been a lot of speculation as to what games will be offered in the poker room. Some believe that the casino will tailor its poker offerings towards recreational players, while others believe that there will be a good mix of low and high stakes games. No one knows for sure what to expect until the casino actually opens its doors.

One thing that is for sure is that the casino management is very excited about the poker room. In an interview with Poker News Daily, Director of Table Games Michael McNeely said "We are very excited about our new 14-table Poker Room. We have put together a great staff and we are looking forward to providing our guests with a great Poker experience."

The Casino at Danville looks like it could be a great option for poker players in Virginia and North Carolina. With so many casinos opening up in the Northeast, it will be interesting to see how this casino competes against its rivals.

#  Waiting Game Continues for Poker News at Danville VA Casino

The poker room at the Danville VA casino remains closed with no clear end in sight. Originally slated to open in late March, the poker room has faced multiple delays and is now not expected to open until later this summer at the earliest.

This is disappointing news for local poker players, who were looking forward to having a place to play in their own backyard. The only other nearby option for live poker is the Horseshoe Casino in Baltimore, which is a two-hour drive from Danville.

Some players are hoping that the delay will give them time to convince the casino management to add some higher-stakes games. The only games currently offered are $1/$2 and $2/$5 No Limit Hold’em and Pot Limit Omaha.

Others are hoping that the delay will lead to better amenities in the poker room, such as more comfortable chairs or perhaps even a dedicated bar area.

In the meantime, there are still some options for online poker players in Virginia. There are several legal, licensed and regulated online poker sites that accept players from Virginia. These include industry leaders like PokerStars, Partypoker and 888poker.

#  Poker Players Anticipate Danville VA Casino Opening

In late March, the Danville City Council gave final approval for a $50 million casino development on the south side of the city. The new casinos will be operated by Eldorado Resorts Inc. and is expected to create close to 300 jobs.

The gaming industry in Virginia has been on the rise in recent years, with more than a dozen casinos now open throughout the state. For poker players, the opening of the Danville casino is good news, as it will offer another option for playing their favorite game.

According to industry experts, poker is one of the most popular games in casinos, accounting for more than 60% of all casino gambling revenues. This is due in part to the fact that poker is a skill-based game that can be won or lost based on player decisions.

Casinos are increasingly offering poker rooms, and many are investing in technology that allows for multi-table play. This allows players to compete against each other from around the world without having to leave their home or hotel room.

For players looking for a live poker experience, the opening of the Danville casino will be welcome news. The casino will offer a variety of table games including blackjack, roulette and craps, as well as a selection of slot machines.
