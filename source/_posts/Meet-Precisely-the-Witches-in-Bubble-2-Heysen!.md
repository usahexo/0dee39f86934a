#  Meet Precisely the Witches in Bubble 2 Heysen!

Bubble 2 Heysen is the second bubble in the Heysen Trail, and wanders along the southern slope of Mount Lofty. The Precisely the Witches painting by Hans Heysen is located here, and has been attracting artists, locals and visitors since it was painted in 1937.

The artwork is based on a group of sisters who lived in the area, known as the Precisely the Witches because of their precision with herbs and healing. The painting captures their spirit perfectly, with bright colours and an uplifting feeling.

The original painting is now part of the Art Gallery of South Australia collection, but you can still visit Bubble 2 Heysen to see a replica. There’s also a walking track that takes you past some of Hans Heysen’s other famous artworks, including My Sister’s Garden.

If you’re looking for a peaceful spot to take in some beautiful art and nature, Bubble 2 Heysen is definitely worth a visit!

#  Precisely What are the Witch Names in Bubble 2 Heysen? 

If you're a Bubble 2 Heysen player, you'll know that one of the big new features in the game is witch names. But what do they do? And more importantly, what are they?

There are six witches in Bubble 2 Heysen: Mildred, Zelda, Lucy, Sarah, Violet and Emma. As you play the game, they'll give you helpful tips and advice. For example, Zelda will tell you when your bubbles are about to burst, while Mildred will give you power-ups to help you beat your opponents.

Each of the witches also has her own special ability. Zelda can teleport herself anywhere on the screen, Lucy can create duplicates of herself, Sarah can shoot fireballs and so on. So make sure to keep an eye on their moving lips - that's how you'll know when they're talking!

So there you have it - the witch names in Bubble 2 Heysen! Now go out there and start popping some bubbles!

#  Who are the two witches in Bubble 2 Heysen?

The two witches in Bubble 2 Heysen are the antagonists of the show. They are portrayed as evil and mean, always scheming and trying to cause trouble for the other residents of the bubble.

Despite being villains, the two witches are some of the most popular characters on the show. This is likely due to their over-the-top antics and hilarious dialogue. Viewers can’t help but love to hate them!

#  Bubble 2 Heysen: Which Witch is Which? 

It is often said that there are two types of people in this world: those who see the glass as half-full, and those who see it as half-empty. But what about those of us who see the glass as completely full of bubbles? This is where we find ourselves with Bubble 2 Heysen. The question on everyone’s lips is - which witch is which?

We have the two co-leaders of the SA Labor Party, Deputy Premier John Rau and State Treasurer Tom Koutsantonis. Both are powerful men in their own right, but there can only be one Heysen Bubble King (or Queen).

John Rau is often seen as the more experienced and senior of the two, but Tom Koutsantonis has been known to play a few dirty tricks in his time. Who will be crowned Bubble King? Only time will tell.

#  Can You Guess the Two Witches in Bubble 2 Heysen?

Some keen eyed art enthusiasts might be able to guess the two witches in one of the Heysen Bubble murals. The mural is located in Bowden, South Australia and was painted by Hans Heysen.

The two witches are located on the left hand side of the mural, just below the tree. They are both wearing black dresses and hats with white lace around the edge. One witch is looking down at something while the other one is looking towards the viewer.

Interestingly, there is a debate about who the two witches actually are. Some people believe that they are Elizabeth I and Mary, Queen of Scots, while others believe that they are Heysen's mother and sister. No one can be sure who they are, but it's an interesting topic for discussion nonetheless!
