#  Players React to Nextbet's Poker Challenge

Nextbet, a Malta-based online gambling company, announced the launch of its new poker challenge this week. The challenge offers players the chance to win a total of €1 million in prize money, with the top prize being €250,000.

The challenge is open to all players, regardless of experience or skill level. In order to participate, players must first wager at least €10 on any poker game. They then have the chance to play in one of five qualifying tournaments, each with a €20 buy-in. The top five players from each tournament will progress to the final showdown, where they will compete for the €250,000 top prize.

Many of Nextbet's online poker players reacted positively to the launch of the new challenge. Some commented that it was good to see such a large prize pool offered and looked forward to testing their skills against others in the hope of winning big. Others were more cautious, pointing out that the qualifiers were not easy and that only a small percentage of players would make it through to the final showdown.

Regardless of their opinions on the challenge itself, all players seem keen to take part and see how far they can go. As one player put it: "€10 is nothing when you're playing for €250,000."
