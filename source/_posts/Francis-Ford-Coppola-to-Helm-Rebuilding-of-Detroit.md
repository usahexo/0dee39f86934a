#  Francis Ford Coppola to Helm Rebuilding of Detroit

One of the great American filmmakers, Francis Ford Coppola, has announced a plan to help rebuild Detroit.

After years of decline, Detroit is in need of help. Coppola's plan is to use his experience in filmmaking to create jobs and revive downtown Detroit.

Coppola isn't doing this alone- he's teamed up with billionaire Dan Gilbert, who has been a driving force behind the city's resurgence.

The two have already bought several buildings in downtown Detroit and they're planning on turning them into a film studio, hotel, restaurant, and wine store.

This is great news for Detroit and its residents. Coppola is a well-respected filmmaker and his involvement will undoubtedly attract other businesses to the city.

#  Francis Ford Coppola to Produce 'Chumash Casino' in Santa Barbara

According to a recent press release, the film will be set in the fictional town of Chumash, California and will tell the story of "a young man who must face his personal demons while struggling to keep his family’s casino business afloat."

Coppola has been developing the project for over two years and is reportedly very excited about it. “This is a powerful and moving story that I’m thrilled to bring to the screen,” he said in a statement. “I’m grateful for the opportunity to work with the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians and their casino resort as partners on this project.”

The Chumash Casino Resort has also expressed excitement about the project, noting that it will provide jobs and economic opportunities for local residents. Construction on the new film is scheduled to begin this fall.

#  Francis Ford Coppola Developing $700M Casino Resort in Santa Barbara

After months of rumors and speculation, Francis Ford Coppola confirmed plans to develop a $700 million luxury casino resort in Santa Barbara. The filmmaker, who has been living in the area for the past few years, announced the project on Wednesday at a news conference in nearby Montecito.

"We're going to create an Italian village right here on the Central Coast," Coppola told a roomful of reporters. "This is my passion."

The proposed casino resort would feature 128 hotel rooms, a spa, several restaurants, and - of course - a gambling hall. It would be built on a 62-acre site that Coppola recently purchased just off Highway 101.

Coppola's project is one of several casino resorts being planned or developed in California. Pokerstars mogul Isai Scheinberg is building a $4 billion complex in the Inland Empire, and Lawrence Ho is spending $1.5 billion on a project in North Las Vegas.

Opponents of gambling say the projects will only promote addiction and social ills, while proponents argue they will create jobs and bring much-needed revenue to cash-strapped municipalities.

So far there has been no word on when Coppola's resort might open or how many people it might employ.

#  Francis Ford Coppola's Latest Venture: The Chumash Casino Resort

Hollywood producer Francis Ford Coppola is diversifying his business interests with a new venture: the Chumash Casino Resort in Santa Ynez, California. The resort, which has been under construction for two years, is set to open in December 2018.

The Chumash Casino Resort will feature a 350-room hotel, a spa, three restaurants, and a casino with more than 2,000 slot machines and 40 table games. It will also offer entertainment venues including a 2,000-seat arena and a 1,500-seat theater.

Coppola is no stranger to the casino industry; he already owns two resorts in Las Vegas. But the Chumash Casino Resort will be his first venture into California's $7.2 billion Indian gaming market.

Native American tribes have been operating casinos since the early 1990s, after the federal government granted them the right to do so in order to promote economic development on their reservations. There are now more than 240 Indian casinos in the United States.

The Chumash Casino Resort is expected to generate $300 million in annual revenue and create 2,000 jobs. It is also expected to benefit local businesses and generate tax revenue for Santa Barbara County.

Coppola is not the only Hollywood heavyweight getting into Indian gaming; last year DreamWorks Animation opened DreamWorks Delhi Natives, an Indian casino resort near New Delhi.
