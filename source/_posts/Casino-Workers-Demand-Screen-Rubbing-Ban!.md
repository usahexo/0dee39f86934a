#  Casino Workers Demand Screen-Rubbing Ban!

Casino workers in Las Vegas are calling for a ban on screen rubbing following an outbreak of the flu. Casino employees are asking for the ban to be put into place to help stop the spread of the virus.

More than 100 workers at the MGM Grand have come down with the flu in recent weeks, and many are blaming the screen rubbing that is common among casino workers. The flu has been spreading rapidly throughout other casinos in Las Vegas as well, and workers are concerned about their health and safety.

Screen rubbing is when a worker rubs their hands together after handling money or cards. The action transfers oils and dirt from your hands to your face, which can lead to the spread of bacteria and viruses.

In a letter to the president of MGM Resorts International, union leaders wrote, "Our members are coming down with respiratory illnesses at an alarming rate... it's time for MGM to take action and prohibit this practice."

MGM has yet to make a decision on whether or not they will implement a ban on screen rubbing. In a statement, they said, "MGM Resorts takes the health and safety of our team members seriously... we are currently exploring all potential options."

Aside from the fact that they're designed to take your money, slot machines are just plain boring. There's nothing more frustrating than putting in a bunch of coins and not winning anything in return.

Slot machines also tend to attract cheaters. There have been cases where people have rigged the machines to make it look like they're winning, when in reality they're just taking other people's money. This is why I hate slot machines - they're nothing but a waste of time and money.

#  Do Slot Machine Manufacturers Know About the Screen-Rubbing Phenomenon?

In recent years, screen-rubbing has become an increasingly common issue on slot machines. This is when players rub their screens for extended periods of time in order to get a better view of the game. Unfortunately, this can often lead to smudging and scratching of the screen, which can severely impact the gameplay experience.

So do slot machine manufacturers know about this issue? And if so, what are they doing to address it?

Well, as far as we can tell, most manufacturers are aware of the screen-rubbing phenomenon. In fact, some have even taken steps to address it. For example, Aristocrat Technologies has implemented a "finger guard" feature on some of its machines. This is essentially a rubber strip that runs along the bottom of the screen, which helps to protect it from scratches and smudges.

Other manufacturers have taken a more simple approach: they've just increased the size of the screen itself. This makes it harder for players to reach across the entire surface area with their hands, which reduces the amount of rubbing that occurs.

Ultimately, it's up to the individual manufacturer to decide how best to deal with this issue. Some may choose to implement protective measures, while others may simply increase the size of the screen. However, one thing is for sure: screen-rubbing is a problem that isn't going away anytime soon. So it's important that manufacturers take whatever steps they can to mitigate its effects.
